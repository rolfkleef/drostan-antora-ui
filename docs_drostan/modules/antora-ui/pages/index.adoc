= Antora UI

This section contains additional documentation for the drostan.org version of the UI.

== Antora defaults and limitations

* Antora uses the front-end highlight.js library for syntax highlighting.
  It registers its own set of languages instead of the highlight.js common set:
+
:cb1: 
.src/js/vendor/highlight.bundle.js
[source, javascript, indent=0]
....
include::./../examples/highlight.bundle.js[]
....
+
For the drostan version, we adapted the list of languages.

* Check include relative path within component
+
[source, yaml]
....
include::../examples/antora.yml[]
....
+
<.> Use this as internal name, in URLs and cross-references.
<.> Display version `master` as `main`.

* Antora changes the `include::` directive to work with pages and examples,
but it seems to break showing raw source code via a path outside the content module.
